Bus Reservation System is a pretty fully functional system developed using Tkinter (GUI), SQLite, and Python, which is designed to automate online ticket purchasing through an easy online bus booking system. With the bus ticket reservation system, you can manage/book reservations, clients data and passenger lists, and can add new buses or new routes as an Operator admin. In the end, the user will have a proper ticket for his/her booking.
