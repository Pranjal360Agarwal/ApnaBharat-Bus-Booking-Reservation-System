## Tkinter- Login/SignUp Page
<ul>
  <li>Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit.</li>
  <li>It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI.</li>
</ul>

- [ ] In the branch named ```Features``` we can observe the folder named ```Login System Architecture```
#### There are essentially three files that contains the code that is explaining the process of navigation of the sign-up functionality.
<ol>
  <li>Login Form</li>
  <li>Login Form Database</li>
  <li>Final Page Navigation</li>
 </ol>
 
 #### To easily understand the code we basically have divided it in three process:
<ol>
  <li>Creating Login Form</li>
  <li>Creating Signup/ Registration Form with Databases</li>
  <li>Create Login System using Tkinter</li>
</ol>

```bash
The 'Final Page Navigation' file contains both code from Login Form & Databse.
```

#### Furthermore, as you can see there are three more files in this folder. Two of which are the image files for adding an better UI for the user to experience.
#### The ```dataset.txt``` file contains all the credentials from new user Sign-ups.
